QPME ChangeLog

Version 2.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:

  – Central queue management and support for having multiple queueing places
    that share the same underlying physical queue.

  – Advanced query engine for processing and visualization of simulation results.

  – Support for simulating hierarchical QPNs using SimQPN.

  – Support for defining probes that specify metrics of interest for which data
    should be collected.

  – Support for empirical and deterministic distributions.

  – Improved performance and scalability of the simulation engine (SimQPN).

  – Automatic detection of infinitely growing queues (model instability).

  – A number of features improving user friendliness (e.g., simulation progress
    bar and "stop simulation" button).

  - New simulation configuration parameters "bucketSize" and "maxBuckets" to customize
    histogram creation.

  - New example model SPECjms2007Model.qpe included which demonstrates the use
    of shared queues.

Changes:

  - Names of QPN elements (places, transitions, colors, etc.) are required to be unique.
  
  - Renamed Parameter "Confidence Interval Length" in simulation run wizard to "Confidence
    Interval Half Length" to clarify its meaning.

  - Check before running simulation that each immediate transition contains at least on mode
    requiring input tokens. Warn user if that is not the case.

  - Based on current Eclipse 3.6 version.


Bugs fixed:

  - Empirical distribution fixed.

  - Added various checks to avoid NullPointerExceptions due to modelling errors (e.g. missing
    queues in queueing places)

  - Fixed bug in query editor only showing one of several places sharing the same name.

  - Unable to load .qpe-Files with identifiers containing special characters (e.g. german umlaute)

  - When opening the Incidence Function Editor nothing is displayed inside its window. Only after
    dragging the mouse pointer, the incidence function is shown.

  - Various bugs causing inconstencies in the model were fixed (e.g. when deleting elements from the
    net, corresponding connections are removed as well)

  - Various Null Pointer Exceptions fixed in simulation configuration wizard.

  - Fixed focus handling in the parameters table of the simulation configuration wizard.
